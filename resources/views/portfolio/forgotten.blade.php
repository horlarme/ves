    <h1>Biography of the Forgotten</h1>

      <p>As a contemporary Nigerian artist, I have a constant urge to see, learn, and continue an ongoing narrative told by my ancestors; the undocumented artists whose works are labelled “anonymous.” My work, thus, pays homage to my forebears and their contributions to the art world, from the classicists to the modernists.</p>
      <p>Contemporary artists like myself privilege an actual depth that is beyond what critics have been able to access in documented texts like books and exhibition brochures. The visual references and residual meanings of the neo-natural synthesis artist run deep; hence, my installation proposes a duality of purpose. “A Biography of The Forgotten” could also suggest diverse contexts of appreciation or appropriation to modern artists for whom history has not been kind. This is despite their contributions to modernism and contemporary Nigerian art.</p>
      <p>In a response to Ulli Beier’s comment during an interview —“…we are actually witnessing a kind or regenerative process of the culture now. There is a process of rethinking – a new consciousness. I am thinking artists like Uche Okeke and Obiora Udechukwu,”—Chinua Achebe responded, “Well, it is difficult to put into words, but it’s not like going back to something ‘primitive.’ We must explain the need for this movement from our recent history. The change in our society has not been a gradual development; it’s been brutal— like a violent incision, a breach of continuity. Through colonialism your initiative is taken from you; you are thrown out of your history and into somebody’s history.”</p>
      <p>I seek to profusely acknowledge and revisit the Zaria Art Society’s Natural Synthesis ideology, later championed by Uche Okeke, especially as he has recently transited to the great beyond. There is the need to re-examine an artist’s return to his community to make art from what I now refer to as Neo-Natural Synthesis. This contemplation on the old and the way it influences and inspires my art practice is joire de vivre. It takes into cognizance the fact that Uche Okeke, Demas Nwoko, Bruce Onobrakpeya, and their peers, pulled the western wool from the eyes of Nigerian artists. Those who care to reflect can see the origin of their influences, which is not only what is learned in classrooms, but also the creative flare they inspire. For me, shying away from neo-natural synthesis is to immolate artistically. I cling to memory and keep returning to the art I consumed as a child in local shrines, memorial walls, and places of worship in Uwessan village. Traditional artists who created these masterpieces took their calling seriously, hence the intricacies and beauties that arrested my curiosity until I left home.</p>
      <p>I hold in high esteem the bronze casters from the historic Igun Street, in the heart of the ancient Benin Kingdom, where most of the artworks stolen by colonial marauders were created. Igun Street is a world heritage site, in Benin City, Edo State. Though I grew up knowing of this community, my first significant artistic encounter with the guild of casters from Igun was in December 2014. Since then, especially when I come across early Benin bronzes in museums around the world, I realize even further the range of their influence.</p>
      <p>In the “A Biography of the Forgotten” installation, mirrors and bronze statuettes are interwoven into seven large canvases that bear my drawings. The symbolism of the mirror is two-fold: on the one hand, it was one of the objects the white man exchanged for African art, commodities, and human slaves. It also serves as a metaphor for self-reflection— a selfie if you like—a way of introspection. With my work it is my aspiration to wake up an aspect of history that seems to be gathering dust in the memories of the colonizers and the colonized and there is no better time to that but NOW.</p>
