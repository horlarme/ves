                            <p class="lead">Victor Ehikhamenor is an artist, photographer and writer born in the village of Udomi-Uwessan, Nigeria. Ehikhamenor has been prolific in producing abstract, symbolic and politically motivated works.</p>
                            <p>His works are influenced by duality of African traditional religion and the interception 
                                of Western beliefs, memories and nostalgia. His symbols and motifs are reminiscent of his 
                                childhood village shrines art as well as the Catholicism that was inherent in his village. 
                                Ever the storyteller, regardless of how his works are rendered on the surface – by charcoal, acrylic, enamel, nail perforations, video installations – his intent is that these images portend an enchanted world inspired by everyday life both urban and rural, folktales, stories, histories real and imagined. </p>
