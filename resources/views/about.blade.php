                            and

                        <p class="lead">Victor Ehikhamenor is an artist, photographer and writer born in the village of
                            Udomi-Uwessan, Nigeria. Ehikhamenor has been prolific in producing abstract, symbolic and
                            politically motivated works.</p>
                        <p>His works are influenced by duality of African traditional religion and the interception of
                            Western beliefs, memories and nostalgia. His symbols and motifs are reminiscent of his
                            childhood
                            village shrines art as well as the Catholicism that was inherent in his village.
                            Ehikhamenor’s
                            images always work as a proliferation of forms – of figures, shapes and appearances. His
                            canvasses are folded into deliberate forms, becoming personable objects on display.</p>
                        <p>Ever the storyteller, regardless of how his works are rendered on the surface – by charcoal,
                            acrylic, enamel, nail perforations, video installations – his intent is that these images
                            portend an enchanted world inspired by everyday life both urban and rural, folktales,
                            stories,
                            histories real and imagined.</p>
                        <p>Ehikhamenor has had numerous exhibitions with strong following in Nigeria, the United States,

                            Future”,
