                            <p class="lead">Victor Ehikhamenor is an artist, photographer and writer born in the village of Udomi-Uwessan, Nigeria. Ehikhamenor has been prolific in producing abstract, symbolic and politically motivated works.</p>
                            <p>His works are influenced by duality of African traditional religion and the interception of Western beliefs, memories and nostalgia. His symbols and motifs are reminiscent of his childhood village shrines art as well as the Catholicism that was inherent in his village. Ehikhamenor’s images always work as a proliferation of forms – of figures, shapes and appearances. His canvasses are folded into deliberate forms, becoming personable objects on display.</p>
                            <p>Ever the storyteller, regardless of how his works are rendered on the surface – by charcoal, acrylic, enamel, nail perforations, video installations – his intent is that these images portend an enchanted world inspired by everyday life both urban and rural, folktales, stories, histories real and imagined.</p>
                            <p>Ehikhamenor has had numerous exhibitions with strong following in Nigeria, the United States, Asia, the UK and other parts of Europe.

He was also one of the eleven Nigerian artists at the 2015 Jogja Biennale in Indonesia where he presented his monumental installation, “The Wealth of Nations”. One of the three artists at the first Nigerian Pavilion in the Venice Biennale, “A Biography of the Forgotten” was the work showcased at the the 57th Venice Biennale (2017).</p>
                            <p>As a writer he has published numerous fiction and critical essays with academic journals, mainstream magazines and newspapers round the world including New York Times, BBC, CNN Online, Washington Post, Farafina, AGNI magazine, Wasafiri Magazine and others.
